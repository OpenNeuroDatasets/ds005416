In this study, we selected 24 electrodes for EEG recording: Fp1, Fp2, AF3, AF4, F7, Fz, F8, FC5, FC6 (frontal), FT7, FT8 (temporal), C3, Cz, C4, CP3, CP4 (central), P3, Pz, P4, PO3, PO4 (parietal), and O1, Oz, O2 (occipital).
Each participant was required to complete watching 2 resting scenes and 15 movement scenes. 
A rating scene appeared to rate each exercise scene watched. 
Each movement scene consisted of 20 trials of reciprocal periodic movements at a fixed depth and velocity.
We focused on analyzing EEG data from watching resting scenes. 
Researchers can use this EEG data to do resting-state analysis (corresponding to events '11' and '13') as well as task-state analysis (corresponding to event '12').
